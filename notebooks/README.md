# Collection of jupyter notebooks
This directory lists a collection of notebooks that are used for data preprocessing 
and results analysis.

In order to use the conda environment we previously created inside jupyter, the following
commands should be executed:

1) ```conda activate bias-research```
2) ```conda install notebook```
3) ```python -m ipykernel install --user --name=bias-research```
